# File Upload and Download System

This repository contains a Node.js application for handling file uploads, listing file information, and downloading files. The application consists of a server-side component built with Node.js, Express, Multer, and Cors, as well as a client-side component using Vite and React.

## Basic Information

The Backend/Server Node.js Application provides the following APIs:

- **Upload**: Allows users to upload files/images to MongoDB.
- **Get Files**: Retrieves a list of files' information, including file name and URL.
- **Download File**: Enables users to download a file/image from the server using the provided URL.

2. Navigate to the `client` directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
5. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Server Code (Node.js, Express, Multer, Cors)

The server-side code is built with Node.js, Express, Multer, and Cors. It handles file uploads, stores file data in MongoDB and provides APIs for listing and downloading files.

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `server` directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Start the server using `npm start`.
5. The server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
